Yes. Server-side tracking is available in the Pro version. It helps you bypass ad blockers, iOS restrictions, and ensures more accurate tracking.

Yes! You can use your own GTM container or take advantage of Conversiosâ€™ pre-configured containers for faster deployment.

= Is Conversios compatible with Consent Mode v2? =
Yes! Conversios fully supports Google Consent Mode v2 to ensure privacy compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other regulations.

= Where can I report a bug or request a new feature? =
You can email us at [support@conversios.io](mailto:support@conversios.io) or open a support thread on the WordPress.org forums.

= What should I do if conversions are not showing in Google Ads or Meta? =
Double-check that your conversion ID and label (Google) or Pixel ID (Meta) are correct. If you're using caching or security plugins, whitelist Conversios scripts to ensure events are properly tracked.

Yes. In the settings, you can enable or disable individual GA4, Ads, or Meta events. Pro users can also request custom event mappings through support.

= Will server-side tracking work on Safari and iOS browsers? =
Yes. Server-side tracking improves tracking specifically for Safari, iOS, and ad-blocked browsers by sending data from the server - bypassing browser-level restrictions. Learn more about how it helps recover lost data and improve first-party tracking [in this guide](https://www.conversios.io/blog/how-server-side-tagging-improves-first-party-data/?utm_source=wpfaqs&utm_medium=safari_ios&utm_campaign=pluginreadme).

= Can I track custom events with Conversios? =

Yes! Conversios allows you to track custom events through our advanced event tracking system. You can customize the events you want to track directly from the plugin settings, including user actions and specific page visits. Pro users can also request custom event mappings through support.

= What happens if my website has a caching plugin enabled? =

If you have a caching plugin installed, we recommend whitelisting Conversios' scripts to prevent any interference with tracking. This ensures that tracking data is sent correctly, even when cache is active.
